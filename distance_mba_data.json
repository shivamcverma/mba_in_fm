Yes — gap-year students are very likely eligible for admission (unless there's a hidden internal rule) SPR's eligibility depends only on having a valid 10+2 (or equivalent) pass + entrance exam score; There is no public restriction on “when” the 10+2 was passed; There is no age criterion or explicit clause about continuity of education; It follows that students who completed 10+2 some time ago, even if they took a break (gap years), should be eligible for admission — as long as they meet the academic and entrance-exam requirements.",

The official fee data for SPR lists tuition (and other components like security deposit, hostel fee etc.) for various courses, but the published “tuition fee” appears as a total amount or per-year amount, not explicitly per-semester. For instance: for B.Pharm at SPR, the “tuition fee” is quoted as ~ INR 4.6 Lacs total (or full course basis) rather than per semester. The publicly available fee descriptions on sites summarizing SPR's fee structure always mention “tuition fee”, “security deposit”, “hostel fee / other fees etc.” as separate components.",
